# Here It Is
I am an Ethereum enthusiast and core developer liason with a rich background in blockchain projects. Since first discovering Bitcoin in 2011 I have played an active role in various online communities for decentralized technology, including Dash and Ethereum. After spending two years at USAA starting their blockchain program, I left to work at the Ethereum Foundation. I also co-founded Oaken Innovations, an IoT security start-up that utilizes distributed/decentralized software. Some things I enjoy include converting VHS tapes to digital formats, playing tabletop RPGs with friends, TV shows targeted at millennials, Overwatch, and cookies 'n cream flavored ice cream.
